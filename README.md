Replication package for `Revisiting the Dunning-Kruger effect: composite measures and heterogeneity by gender`

This package replicates the results of `Revisiting the Dunning-Kruger effect: composite measures and heterogeneity by gender` by Anna Adamecz, Radina Ilieva, and Nikki Shure in Stata.
After downloading the package, see 1_DK_how_to_run.do for more details. All data are available from the UK Data Service after registration, creating and account, and asking for permission 
at wwww.ukdataservice.ac.uk. If you have any questions, contact me on a.adamecz-volgyi `at` ucl.ac.uk.

There are six folders in the package: four are empty and should accomodate the raw data (Raw data), the data files generated by the do files (once they are run) (Output data), figures (Figures) and tables (Results). Two folders have content: Do contains the do files and Logs contain the logs of our own last running. The new log files will be saved under different names and could be compared to the original ones.
